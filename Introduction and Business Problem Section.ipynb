The data scientist will evaluate the characteristics of the current neighborhood, using available data on the most popular venues in the area, and he will identify similar neighborhoods in Toronto and Manhattan.  He will narrow down the search to neighborhoods where bars are among the most popular venues, indicating a culture of social drinking, while being careful to avoid recommending neighborhoods that have too few bars or too many bars.",
